# Hello, World! üåç

## You have stumbled upon my Github! Enjoy! üëæ

As someone passionate about advancements in technology, I've have focused on projects that bridge the gap between software and hardware. My academic and professional journey has been a blend of CS's logical structuring and EE's understanding of the electronic fundamentals that power our devices.

I specialize in developing comprehensive systems that necessitate a deep understanding of both the software that drives user interactions and the hardware that executes the processes. My projects range from software applications to hardware, each designed with the purpose of advancing how we interact with technology.
